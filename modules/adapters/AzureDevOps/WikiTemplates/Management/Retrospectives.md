## Recurring Themes & Patterns

### Top 5 Most Common Challenges (Last 6 Months)
1. **Meetings taking too much time** (mentioned 8 times)
   - **Trend**: Consistent issue, slight improvement in Sprint 16-17
   - **Root Cause**: Ad-hoc meetings, no agenda, too many attendees
   - **Actions Taken**: Meeting audit, mandatory agendas, optional attendees

2. **Technical debt accumulation** (mentioned 6 times)
   - **Trend**: Getting worse
   - **Root Cause**: Pressure to deliver features, no dedicated time for refactoring
   - **Actions Taken**: Allocating 15-20% capacity for tech debt starting Sprint 19

3. **Unclear requirements** (mentioned 5 times)
   - **Trend**: Improving with new acceptance criteria template
   - **Root Cause**: Insufficient backlog refinement, lack of examples
   - **Actions Taken**: Mandatory refinement 3 days before sprint start

4. **Knowledge silos** (mentioned 5 times)
   - **Trend**: Persistent issue
   - **Root Cause**: Specialization, lack of pairing, no documentation
   - **Actions Taken**: Pair programming encouraged, wiki documentation, knowledge sharing sessions

5. **Flaky tests** (mentioned 4 times)
   - **Trend**: Resolved in Sprint 18
   - **Root Cause**: Race conditions, timing issues, environment inconsistency

## Retrospective Best Practices

### What Makes a Good Retrospective

#### ✅ DO
1. **Create psychological safety**: No blame, focus on systems not people
2. **Timebox discussions**: Use a timer, keep energy high
3. **Focus on actionable items**: Every issue should have potential actions
4. **Rotate facilitators**: Different perspectives, shared responsibility
5. **Follow up on actions**: Review previous action items first
6. **Use different formats**: Mix it up to keep engagement high
7. **Celebrate wins**: Start with positives, build momentum
8. **Data-driven**: Use metrics, examples, concrete observations

#### ❌ DON'T
1. **Don't skip retrospectives**: Even when busy, they're critical
2. **Don't let managers dominate**: Team members should speak freely
3. **Don't create action items without owners**: Every action needs an owner and due date
4. **Don't repeat without action**: If same issues come up, take different actions
5. **Don't make it a venting session**: Focus on solutions, not just problems
6. **Don't ignore the data**: Review actual metrics, not just feelings

# Test Strategy & Planning

Comprehensive test strategy framework for planning and executing effective testing initiatives.

---

## 🎯 Test Strategy Overview

### Purpose

A test strategy defines:
- **What** we test (scope and coverage)
- **How** we test (approaches and methods)
- **When** we test (phases and timeline)
- **Who** tests (roles and responsibilities)

### Strategy Components

1. **Test Scope**: Features and systems to test
2. **Test Approach**: Types of testing to perform
3. **Entry/Exit Criteria**: When to start/stop testing
4. **Test Environment**: Infrastructure requirements
5. **Risk Assessment**: Identify and mitigate risks
6. **Resource Plan**: Team allocation and tools

---

## 📋 Test Planning Process

### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis

**Activities**
- Review functional and non-functional requirements
- Identify testable requirements
- Clarify ambiguous requirements with stakeholders
- Document assumptions and constraints

**Deliverables**
- Requirements traceability matrix
- List of testable requirements
- Risk assessment document

### Phase 2: Test Scope Definition

**In Scope**
- ✅ New features and functionality
- ✅ Modified existing features
- ✅ Integration points
- ✅ Critical business workflows
- ✅ Security and compliance requirements
- ✅ Performance-critical paths

**Out of Scope**
- ❌ Third-party library internals
- ❌ Unmodified legacy features (unless regression risk)
- ❌ Infrastructure not owned by team
- ❌ Manual-only processes with no automation value

### Phase 3: Test Approach Selection

**Testing Types Matrix**

| Type | When | Coverage | Automation |
|------|------|----------|------------|
| Unit | Development | 70% | Yes |
| Integration | Build | 20% | Yes |
| System | Pre-deployment | 10% | Partial |
| UAT | Staging | Key flows | Manual |
| Performance | Weekly | Critical APIs | Yes |
| Security | Sprint end | OWASP Top 10 | Yes |

## 🎨 Test Levels

### Unit Testing

**Scope**: Individual functions, methods, classes

**Approach**
```csharp
// Test business logic in isolation
[Fact]
public void CalculateDiscount_LoyalCustomer_AppliesCorrectPercentage()
{
    // Arrange
    var calculator = new DiscountCalculator();
    var customer = new Customer { LoyaltyTier = "Gold", YearsActive = 5 };
    
    // Act
    var discount = calculator.Calculate(customer, orderTotal: 100);
    
    // Assert
    Assert.Equal(15, discount); // Gold = 15% discount
}
```

**Entry Criteria**
- Code compiles without errors
- Code review completed
- Dependencies mocked

**Exit Criteria**
- All unit tests pass
- Code coverage ≥ 80%
- No critical bugs

### Integration Testing

**Scope**: Component interactions, API contracts, database operations

**Approach**
```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task CreateOrder_WithPayment_UpdatesInventoryAndNotifiesCustomer()
{
    // Arrange
    var orderService = _testServer.Services.GetService<IOrderService>();
    
    // Act
    var order = await orderService.CreateOrderAsync(testOrderData);
    
    // Assert - Multiple systems verified
    Assert.Equal("Confirmed", order.Status);
    
    var inventory = await _inventoryService.GetStockAsync(productId);
    Assert.Equal(expectedStock, inventory.Quantity);
    
    var notification = await _notificationService.GetLastNotificationAsync(customerId);
    Assert.Equal("Order Confirmation", notification.Subject);
}
```

**Entry Criteria**
- Unit tests passing
- Test environment available
- Test data prepared

**Exit Criteria**
- All integration tests pass
- API contracts validated
- No integration defects

### System Testing

**Scope**: End-to-end workflows, cross-system functionality

**Test Scenarios**
1. **Happy Path**: Normal user journey
2. **Alternative Paths**: Valid variations
3. **Error Paths**: Validation and error handling
4. **Boundary Cases**: Limits and edge cases

**Example Test Case**
```
Test Case: TC-001 - Complete Purchase Flow

Preconditions:
- User logged in with valid account
- Product in stock
- Valid payment method on file

Steps:
1. Navigate to product catalog
2. Select product and add to cart
3. Review cart contents
4. Proceed to checkout
5. Confirm shipping address
6. Select payment method
7. Review and place order

Expected Results:
- Order confirmation displayed
- Order number generated
- Confirmation email sent
- Inventory reduced
- Payment processed

Pass Criteria:
- All steps complete without errors
- Order visible in order history
- Inventory updated within 30 seconds
```

## 🔍 Test Coverage Strategy

### Functional Coverage

**Priority-Based Testing**

**P0 - Critical (Must Test)**
- User authentication and authorization
- Payment processing
- Data persistence
- Core business workflows
- Security features

**P1 - High (Should Test)**
- Major features
- Common user paths
- Error handling
- Data validation
- Integrations

**P2 - Medium (Good to Test)**
- Secondary features
- Edge cases
- UI elements
- Notifications

**P3 - Low (Nice to Test)**
- Cosmetic features
- Admin-only features
- Rare scenarios

### Risk-Based Testing

**Risk Assessment Matrix**

| Probability → | Low | Medium | High |
|---------------|-----|--------|------|
| **High Impact** | Medium | High | Critical |
| **Medium Impact** | Low | Medium | High |
| **Low Impact** | Low | Low | Medium |

**Risk Factors**
- Complexity of code/feature
- Frequency of use
- Business criticality
- History of defects
- Recent changes

**Mitigation Strategy**
- **Critical**: Extensive testing, multiple test types, exploratory testing
- **High**: Thorough test cases, automation
- **Medium**: Standard test coverage
- **Low**: Smoke testing only

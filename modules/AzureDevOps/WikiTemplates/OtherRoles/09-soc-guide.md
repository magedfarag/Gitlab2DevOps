# 09. Security Operations Center (SOC) Teams Guide: Working in the Security-First Software Factory

## 1. Why this Software Factory exists

Our organisation is moving from project-by-project delivery and manual releases to a software factory model. 
A software factory standardises how we build, test, secure, and release software, using automated pipelines, 
shared platforms, and product‑centric teams.

This move is not cosmetic. Research on thousands of technology organisations shows that teams that deploy more 
often, with shorter lead times, lower change failure rates, and faster recovery from incidents, also achieve 
better business outcomes such as profitability, market share, and customer satisfaction 
(see summaries of the DORA research and the book “Accelerate” by Forsgren, Humble, and Kim at 
https://waydev.co/dora-metrics/ and https://thoughtworks.com/insights/articles/improving-your-bottom-line-with-four-key-metrics).

At the same time, regulators and customers expect secure‑by‑design software and traceable development practices. 
The NIST Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) at https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-218 defines four 
groups of practices we must embed into our way of working:

- Prepare the organization (policies, training, governance).
- Protect the software (secure repos, access control, hardened build and runtime environments).
- Produce well‑secured software (secure design, coding, and testing).
- Respond to vulnerabilities (monitoring, triage, and remediation).

The OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) at https://owaspsamm.org and OWASP DevSecOps guidance at 
https://owasp.org/projects/ together give us a roadmap for maturing our security practices and pipelines. 
Defence and government programmes such as the U.S. DoD DevSecOps “Platform One” software factory show that a 
centrally managed, security‑first platform with hardened components can dramatically shorten authority‑to‑operate 
timelines and improve reuse (see the DoD DevSecOps Reference Design at 
https://dodcio.defense.gov/Library/ and Platform One information at https://p1.dso.mil).

Our Security‑First Software Factory plan brings these ideas into a single, on‑premises, Azure DevOps Server and 
OpenText Fortify‑based platform, reusing the existing security stack and integrating with our change, monitoring, 
and incident processes.


## 2. What your role is expected to own

As part of the Security Operations Center (SOC), you monitor the environment for threats and respond to incidents. 
In the factory, you rely on consistent logging, metrics, and deployment practices to detect issues quickly and 
support rapid, coordinated response.

You are expected to:

- Define detection use‑cases aligned with application and platform behaviour.
- Ensure logging, metrics, and traces from applications and the factory feed into monitoring tools.
- Participate in threat modelling to understand likely attack paths.
- Work with Dev, Platform, and Ops on incident playbooks and exercises.
- Provide feedback from incidents into design and pipeline improvements.

## 3. How your day‑to‑day work changes

Instead of dealing mainly with infrastructure‑level alerts, you now:

- Use richer application and pipeline context to triage alerts.
- Participate in joint incident response with product teams.
- Help define security requirements for logging and monitoring.
- Integrate detection and response checks into the SDLC and pipeline stages.

## 4. Practices to adopt

1. **Use structured, contextual logs.** Encourage use of correlation IDs and consistent formats.
2. **Align detections with attack paths.** Base rules on threat models and real incidents.
3. **Participate in chaos and game days.** Test detection and response capabilities regularly.
4. **Close the feedback loop.** Feed lessons from incidents back into design, controls, and playbooks.
5. **Automate where safe.** Use automated containment for clearly defined scenarios.

## 5. How you collaborate with other teams

- With Dev and Platform: define logging standards and telemetry needs.
- With Security: prioritise detection use‑cases and tune rules.
- With Ops: coordinate incident response and recovery actions.
- With Management: report on threat trends and response performance.

## 6. Metrics that matter for you

- Mean time to detect and respond to security incidents.
- Number of high‑fidelity vs. false‑positive alerts.
- Coverage of critical systems with agreed detection use‑cases.
- Time to implement new detections after discovering a vulnerability or attack.

## 7. Your first 90 days

- Weeks 1–3: Map existing logging and monitoring coverage for key products.
- Weeks 4–8: Prioritise and implement a small set of high‑value detection use‑cases.
- Weeks 9–12: Run at least one joint incident simulation with a product team and refine playbooks.

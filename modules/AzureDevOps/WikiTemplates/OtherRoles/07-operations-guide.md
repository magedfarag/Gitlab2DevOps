# 07. IT Operations and SRE Guide: Working in the Security-First Software Factory

## 1. Why this Software Factory exists

Our organisation is moving from project-by-project delivery and manual releases to a software factory model. 
A software factory standardises how we build, test, secure, and release software, using automated pipelines, 
shared platforms, and product‑centric teams.

This move is not cosmetic. Research on thousands of technology organisations shows that teams that deploy more 
often, with shorter lead times, lower change failure rates, and faster recovery from incidents, also achieve 
better business outcomes such as profitability, market share, and customer satisfaction 
(see summaries of the DORA research and the book “Accelerate” by Forsgren, Humble, and Kim at 
https://waydev.co/dora-metrics/ and https://thoughtworks.com/insights/articles/improving-your-bottom-line-with-four-key-metrics).

At the same time, regulators and customers expect secure‑by‑design software and traceable development practices. 
The NIST Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) at https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-218 defines four 
groups of practices we must embed into our way of working:

- Prepare the organization (policies, training, governance).
- Protect the software (secure repos, access control, hardened build and runtime environments).
- Produce well‑secured software (secure design, coding, and testing).
- Respond to vulnerabilities (monitoring, triage, and remediation).

The OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) at https://owaspsamm.org and OWASP DevSecOps guidance at 
https://owasp.org/projects/ together give us a roadmap for maturing our security practices and pipelines. 
Defence and government programmes such as the U.S. DoD DevSecOps “Platform One” software factory show that a 
centrally managed, security‑first platform with hardened components can dramatically shorten authority‑to‑operate 
timelines and improve reuse (see the DoD DevSecOps Reference Design at 
https://dodcio.defense.gov/Library/ and Platform One information at https://p1.dso.mil).

Our Security‑First Software Factory plan brings these ideas into a single, on‑premises, Azure DevOps Server and 
OpenText Fortify‑based platform, reusing the existing security stack and integrating with our change, monitoring, 
and incident processes.


## 2. What your role is expected to own

As IT Operations or SRE, you are responsible for the stability, performance, and recovery of production systems. 
In the factory, you work with Dev, Platform, and Security to operate services designed for change and failure.

You are expected to:

- Define and agree service‑level objectives (SLOs) with product teams.
- Operate standardised deployment and rollback mechanisms.
- Participate in capacity and resilience planning.
- Lead or support incident response and post‑incident reviews.
- Provide operational input into design and backlog prioritisation.

## 3. How your day‑to‑day work changes

Instead of mainly protecting stability by limiting change, you now:

- Embrace frequent, automated deployments with strong observability and rollback.
- Use error budgets and SLOs to negotiate change vs. reliability.
- Work with product teams on improving operability and resilience through design.
- Use runbooks and playbooks that are version‑controlled and kept up to date.

## 4. Practices to adopt

1. **SLOs and error budgets.** Define and track reliability targets with product teams.
2. **Operational readiness reviews.** Check operability before new services go live.
3. **Incident analysis.** Focus on learning and system improvements, not blame.
4. **Automation.** Automate repetitive operational tasks and use pipelines for changes.
5. **Observability.** Ensure logs, metrics, and traces support fast diagnosis and recovery.

## 5. How you collaborate with other teams

- With Dev and Platform: design and implement operational features such as health checks and graceful degradation.
- With Security and SOC: coordinate during security incidents and integrate detection with response.
- With Support: share knowledge and ensure that recurring issues are addressed at the right level.
- With Management: report on reliability trends and risk areas.

## 6. Metrics that matter for you

- Mean time to restore (MTTR) for incidents.
- Change failure rate impacting production.
- SLO compliance over time.
- Volume and recurrence of operational incidents.

## 7. Your first 90 days

- Weeks 1–3: Establish baseline SLOs and MTTR metrics for key services.
- Weeks 4–8: Implement or refine operational dashboards and alerting.
- Weeks 9–12: Run joint incident simulations and improve runbooks and playbooks.

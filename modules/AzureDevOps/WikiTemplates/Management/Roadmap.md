## Release Strategy

### Release Cadence
- **Minor releases**: Every 2 weeks (sprint boundary)
- **Major releases**: Quarterly
- **Hotfixes**: As needed (within 24 hours of critical bugs)

### Release Gates
All releases must pass:
- ✅ All automated tests (unit, integration, e2e)
- ✅ Security scan (no critical/high vulnerabilities)
- ✅ Performance benchmarks met
- ✅ Product Owner acceptance
- ✅ Release notes prepared
- ✅ Rollback plan documented

### Deployment Approach
1. **Feature Flags**: Gradual rollout, A/B testing capability
2. **Blue-Green Deployment**: Zero-downtime releases
3. **Canary Releases**: 5% → 25% → 50% → 100% over 48 hours
4. **Automated Rollback**: Automatic rollback on error rate spike

### Roadmap conventions

- Items in **Now** represent committed or in-flight work for the current or next quarter. **Next** and **Later** indicate intent and direction rather than fixed delivery dates.
- The **RICE** scores in this document are comparative tools to support discussion, not absolute truth. When new information appears, re-score and re-prioritize.
- Treat the roadmap as a **communication artefact** for stakeholders: it should explain why priorities are chosen, not just list features.
- Keep roadmap and backlog in sync. When a roadmap item moves or changes meaningfully, ensure the underlying epics and user stories in the backlog are updated as well.

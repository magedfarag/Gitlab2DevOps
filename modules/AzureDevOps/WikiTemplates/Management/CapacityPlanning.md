## Capacity vs. Velocity Correlation

### Story Points per Hour Ratio
| Team | Hours/Sprint | Story Points/Sprint | SP/Hour Ratio |
|------|-------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Team Alpha | 560 hrs | 35 SP | 0.063 SP/hr |
| Team Beta | 490 hrs | 31 SP | 0.063 SP/hr |
| Team Gamma | 420 hrs | 24 SP | 0.057 SP/hr |
| Team Delta | 430 hrs | 27 SP | 0.063 SP/hr |

**Insight**: Consistent 0.06 SP/hour ratio across teams indicates good estimation calibration.

### Predictive Modeling
```
Formula: Expected Story Points = Available Hours × 0.06

Example for Sprint 19:
- Team Alpha: 580 hrs × 0.06 = ~35 SP
- Team Beta: 500 hrs × 0.06 = ~30 SP
- Team Gamma: 400 hrs × 0.06 = ~24 SP
- Team Delta: 450 hrs × 0.06 = ~27 SP
Total: ~116 SP
```

## Meeting & Ceremony Time Allocation

### Recurring Sprint Ceremonies
| Ceremony | Frequency | Duration | Total Time/Sprint |
|----------|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Daily Standup | Daily × 10 days | 15 min | 150 min |
| Sprint Planning | Once | 2 hours | 120 min |
| Sprint Review | Once | 1 hour | 60 min |
| Sprint Retrospective | Once | 1 hour | 60 min |
| Backlog Refinement | 2× per sprint | 1 hour | 120 min |
| **Total per person** | | | **8.5 hours** |

### Additional Meetings (Per Team)
- Architecture Review: 2 hrs/sprint (Tech Leads + Architects)
- Cross-team Sync: 1 hr/week = 2 hrs/sprint (Leads)
- 1-on-1s: 0.5 hrs/week = 1 hr/sprint per person
- All-hands: 1 hr/sprint (entire program)

**Total Meeting Overhead**: ~12-15% of capacity (10-12 hrs per person per sprint)

## Capacity Planning Best Practices

### ✅ DO
1. **Plan conservatively**: Use 70-80% of theoretical capacity
2. **Track actuals**: Compare planned vs. actual to improve forecasting
3. **Account for interruptions**: Reserve 10-15% for unplanned work
4. **Update regularly**: Refresh capacity data each sprint
5. **Include non-dev time**: Meetings, code reviews, learning
6. **Communicate early**: Flag capacity issues before sprint starts
7. **Balance workloads**: Distribute work according to capacity
8. **Factor in complexity**: Some work items need more focused time

### ❌ DON'T
1. **Don't assume 100% productivity**: Unrealistic and leads to burnout
2. **Don't ignore patterns**: Historical data guides future planning
3. **Don't overcommit**: Better to under-promise and over-deliver
4. **Don't forget holidays**: Check calendar for upcoming time off
5. **Don't skip buffer time**: Always reserve capacity for unknowns
6. **Don't ignore team health**: Sustainable pace > maximum velocity

## Capacity Adjustment Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Team Member Joins
- **Week 1-2**: 25% productive capacity (onboarding, learning)
- **Week 3-4**: 50% productive capacity (supervised work)
- **Week 5-8**: 75% productive capacity (gaining independence)
- **Week 9+**: 100% productive capacity (full contributor)

### Scenario 2: Team Member Departure
- **2 weeks before**: 50% capacity (documentation, knowledge transfer)
- **Last week**: 25% capacity (handoff, transition)
- **After departure**: Redistribute work or hire

### Scenario 3: Major Production Incident
- **During incident**: 50% capacity reduction for on-call team
- **Post-incident (1-2 days)**: 25% reduction (RCA, fixes)
- **Recovery (week)**: Return to normal capacity

### Scenario 4: Holiday/Vacation Period
- **Week before holiday**: 90% capacity (people wrapping up)
- **Holiday week**: 60-70% capacity (reduced staffing)
- **Week after holiday**: 85% capacity (people catching up)

## Capacity Planning Tools

### Azure DevOps Capacity Feature
Navigate to: **Boards → Sprints → Capacity**

Set capacity for each team member:
1. Enter days off
2. Set activity allocation (Development, Testing, Design, etc.)
3. Specify hours per day
4. Azure DevOps calculates remaining capacity automatically

### Capacity Dashboard Widgets
Add these widgets to your team dashboard:
- **Sprint Capacity**: Shows planned vs. remaining capacity
- **Sprint Burndown**: Tracks work remaining over time
- **Sprint Velocity**: Historical velocity trends
- **Team Members**: Quick view of who's on the team

### Formulas & Calculations
```powershell
# Total Capacity
$totalCapacity = $teamSize × $sprintDays × $hoursPerDay × $productivityFactor

# Net Capacity
$netCapacity = $totalCapacity - $plannedAbsences - $meetingTime

# Expected Story Points
$expectedSP = $netCapacity × $spPerHourRatio

# Example for 8-person team, 10-day sprint
$totalCapacity = 8 × 10 × 8 × 0.80 = 512 hours
$netCapacity = 512 - 32 (absences) - 64 (meetings) = 416 hours
$expectedSP = 416 × 0.06 = ~25 story points
```

## 📋 Assumptions

### Active Assumptions

| ID | Assumption | Validation Status | Risk if Wrong | Owner |
|----|------------|-------------------|---------------|-------|
| A-001 | Users will adopt OAuth2 over traditional login (80%+ adoption) | 🟡 Partially validated (beta: 65%) | Medium - may need to support both | PO |
| A-002 | Average user session duration will be 15-20 minutes | 🔵 Not validated yet | Low - affects caching strategy | Architect |
| A-003 | Payment processing will be <5% of transactions initially | 🟢 Validated (beta: 3%) | Medium - infrastructure sizing | DevOps |
| A-004 | Users will primarily access from desktop (70/30 split) | 🔴 Invalidated (beta: 55/45) | High - mobile prioritization needed | PO |
| A-005 | Third-party integrations needed for only 20% of users | 🟡 Partially validated | Medium - development effort | PM |

### Assumption Validation Process
1. **Identify** assumption during planning
2. **Document** in RAID log with validation criteria
3. **Test** through beta program or market research
4. **Review** results against criteria
5. **Adjust** plans if assumption proves incorrect

## Issue Escalation Process

### Severity Definitions
- **P1 (Critical)**: System down, data loss, security breach → Immediate response
- **P2 (High)**: Major feature broken, significant user impact → 4-hour response
- **P3 (Medium)**: Minor feature issues, workaround available → 24-hour response
- **P4 (Low)**: Cosmetic issues, enhancement requests → Next sprint

### Escalation Path
1. **L1**: Team identifies issue → Self-resolve within 2 hours
2. **L2**: Team Lead escalation → Cross-team support, 4-hour resolution target
3. **L3**: Delivery Lead escalation → Management involvement, all-hands-on-deck
4. **L4**: Program Manager escalation → Executive notification, vendor engagement

## Dependency Management

### Preventing Dependency Issues
1. **Early identification**: Capture dependencies during sprint planning
2. **Clear communication**: Daily syncs between dependent teams
3. **Buffer time**: Add 20% buffer for inter-team dependencies
4. **Documentation**: API contracts documented before implementation
5. **Integration testing**: Test integrations frequently, not just at end

### When Dependencies Become Blockers
1. **Immediate escalation**: Notify Delivery Lead within 2 hours
2. **Daily status updates**: Until resolved
3. **Workarounds**: Identify temporary solutions (mocks, stubs)
4. **Replanning**: Adjust sprint commitments if needed
5. **Retrospective**: Learn and improve process
